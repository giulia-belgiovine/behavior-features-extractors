# About the Project

This project provides a modular architecture to run quantitative analysis of human behaviors starting from visual source.
Thi is a work in progress. Modules to extract audio features will be integrated soon as well. 

This project was developed to provide a compact framework to perform quantitative analysis and features extraction to study humans behavioral dynamics in human-robot-interactions.
It is based on several state-of-the-art pretrained models.
